Abstract. Microservices based architectures are based on a set of modular, independent and fault-tolerant services. In recent years, the software
engineering community presented studies investigating potential, recurrent, effective architectural patterns in microservices-based architectures,
as they are very essential to maintain and scale microservice-based systems. Indeed, the organizational structure of such systems should be
reflected in so-called microservice architecture patterns, that best fit the
projects and development teams needs. However, there is a lack of public repositories sharing open sources projects microservices patterns and
practices, which could be beneficial for teaching purposes and future
research investigations. This paper tries to fill this gap, by sharing a
dataset, having a first curated list microservice-based projects. Specifically, the dataset is composed of 20 open-source projects, all using specific
microservice architecture patterns. Moreover, the dataset also reports information about inter-service calls or dependencies of the aforementioned
projects. For the analysis, we used two different tools (1) SLOCcount
and (2) MicroDepGraph to get different parameters for the microservice
dataset. Both the microservice dataset and analysis tool are publicly
available online. We believe that this dataset will be highly used by
the research community for understanding more about microservices architectural and dependencies patterns, enabling researchers to compare
results on common projects.
